# Student and Professor Database System (Fall 2018)
## First website created for CPSC332 File Structures and Database Systems 
By Jayro Alvarez

## Technologies/Languages: 
HTML, PHP, SQL, MariaDB, vi, Shell Server

## Learning Experience through project:
This project gave me my first time experience on creating a website. It was the first time I had ever dealth with HTML and PHP, and also using a database. I learned how to create tables with all necessary keys and foreign keys to be able to create flexible queries to allow for efficient data retrieval. 

## Development Interface: 
All development for this project was done on a MacOS system, using the Terminal application to access the CS Shell Server and MariaDB interfaces. From the Linux based shell server, I used vi to create and edit all HTML and PHP files used; from the MariaDB interface I was able to create and manipulate all data tables used.
